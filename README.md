Bath dynamics --- simuating the coherence of a central spin (e.g. an NV center) under the influence of a spin bath evolving with flip-flop dipole-dipole interactions. 
Calculates the coherence as well as the statistics of the field at the central spin. 

LockInPolarAnglesEOM --- comparing the approximate to the exact dynamics of the phase accumulation under imperfect spin rotations e.g. theta = pi + epsilon for non-zero epsilon. 

SemiAnalyticalOptimization --- a means of adjusting a given pulse sequence to minimize the overlap of the noise spectrum with the pulse sequence filter function. 

Enumerating... --- brute force search for the best pulse sequence, for a fixed number of positions at which pulses can be applied.
